# Descartes
Linear Algebra Library based on the exercises in the book *Guide to Scientific Computing in C++, Second Edition* written by Pitt-Francis and Whiteley. **Note that code which is analogous to many parts in this repository is available in the Book's Solution's Manual**, so for these parts I am by no means claiming to have provided novel solutions or functionality, although all codes have been authored by myself originally. The purpose of this project is to learn C++ doing something I enjoy, namely mathematics and linear algebra.
