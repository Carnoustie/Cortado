# Descartes
Linear Algebra repository (some day maybe library) based on the exercises in the book [*Guide to Scientific Computing in C++, Second Edition*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-73132-2) written by Pitt-Francis and Whiteley. **Note that code which is analogous to many parts in this repository is available in the Book's Solution's Manual**, so for these parts I am by no means claiming to have provided novel solutions or functionality, although all codes have been authored by myself originally. As many who might read this might already know, there already exists widely known libraries for linear algebra. The purpose of this project is to learn C++ doing something I enjoy, namely mathematics and linear algebra.
